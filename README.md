## Overview

Optimized frequency and geometry tables of selected peptides are created using the Gaussian program in Atomic and Molecular Physics. Eliminating the necessary data in these extremely long tables constitutes a time-consuming task. Therefore, using the Python programming language, a table can be created in a Word document if the desired range properties are specified.

## ✨ Features

- **Variable Multipliers:** The double scaling factor has a specific coefficient on it and justified values for different multipliers. You can change the values and limit of these multipliers.


- **Delimiting Parameters:** In order to capture the necessary data sets in the sample files included in the study, I selected the closest word on the data sets as the delimiter. You can change this variable to limit it on different files.
